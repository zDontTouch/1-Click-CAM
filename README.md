The 1-Click-CAM is a script for the SAP Integrated Support Environment which aims to streamline the way users log into customer's systems for support. It is a GreaseMonkey-type script that creates and embeds a new button to ServiceNow cases.</br>

Normally, the users need to:
1. Click on the connection button.
2. Click on the CAM button.
3. Select the access level for the support user.
4. Click on the tenant URL to open it.
5. Proceed with the user setup.

When clicking the 1-Click-CAM button, the CAM tool is automatically open and the user access level is already determined. Additionally, the tenant is also automatically open in a background tab.
Furthermore, users can use the "Alternative Tenant URL" textbox to type the tenant URL, in situations where the tenant required is not the same for which the case was opened.
